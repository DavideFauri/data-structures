# data-structures

This repository contains my experiments and exercises in writing traditional data structures and algorithms in Haskell.

At the moment I'm working on:

✔ Environment setup (haskell-language-server + hlint + ormolu)
✔ Test infrastructure (tasty)
☐ Trees

    ✔ Recursive Trees
    ✔ Ordered Trees
    ☐ Traversal
    ☐ Search
    ☐ Red-Black Trees

☐ Matrices

☐ Filters?
    ☐ Kalman
    ☐ EKF
    ☐ UKF
    ☐ Particle Filtering?

☐ Advanced Data Structures
